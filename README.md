Simple game made with godot 4.4 for Ludum Dare 57 with theme Depths.


In this game you become devil whom is trying to escape from the depths of hell. You have to climb up to heaven and avoid falling objects.

Obvious theme reference is depth of hell but as my wife said - this game is endless runner so its quite sad/deep that he will never escape.

use arrow keys to hop left and right
use A and D to move up -> you need to use each hand separately to move up
